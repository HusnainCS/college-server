## About

This project provides the server-side implementation for managing college data such as users (students, faculty, admins), courses, enrollments, schedules, and other resources. Use this README as a guide to set up the project locally and to learn how to run tests and contribute.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for core college resources (users, courses, enrollments, departments)
- Authentication and authorization (JWT or sessions)
- Validation and error handling
- Database integration (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB — configure in env)
- Docker-friendly configuration

> Note: Update the "Features" section to reflect the actual functionality implemented in this repository.

## Tech Stack

- Runtime: Node.js (recommended) — replace if your project uses a different runtime
- Web framework: Express (common choice) — replace if using another framework
- Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB / MySQL (configure in .env)
- Testing: Jest / Mocha (update to match repo)

Update this section with the exact tools, versions and frameworks used by the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14) and npm or yarn installed
- Database server running (Postgres, MongoDB, etc.) if applicable
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized setup)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/HusnainCS/college-server.git
   cd college-server

2. Install dependencies

   npm install
   # or
   yarn install

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and provide the required environment variables. Example:

```
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/college_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=development
```

Update the variables to match your environment and database credentials.

### Run Locally

Start the development server:

```
# with npm
npm run dev

# with yarn
yarn dev
```

The server should be available at http://localhost:4000 (or the port you configured).

## API

Describe the main API resources and endpoints here. For example:

- GET /api/health — Health check
- POST /api/auth/login — Authenticate a user
- POST /api/users — Create a new user
- GET /api/courses — List courses
- POST /api/enrollments — Enroll a student in a course

Include examples of request/response payloads and authentication information.

## Testing

Run tests with:

```
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

Add guidance about integration tests, end-to-end tests, and how to run them (e.g., using a test database).

## Linting & Formatting

If you use ESLint, Prettier, or other tools, add instructions here:

```
npm run lint
npm run format
```

## Deployment

Add notes for deploying the server (Heroku, Vercel, DigitalOcean, Fly.io, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, etc.). If you provide Docker support, include an example:

```
docker build -t college-server .
docker run -p 4000:4000 --env-file .env college-server
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues and pull requests. Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file to describe your workflow, code style, and testing expectations.

## License

Specify a license for the project (e.g., MIT). If unsure, add a LICENSE file with the chosen license.
